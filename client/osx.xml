		<option name="-K" description="  Dont attempt to verify IP, TCP, or UDP checksums. This is useful for interfaces that perform some or all of those checksum calculation in hardware; otherwise, all outgoing TCP checksums will be flagged as bad."/>
		<option name="-l" description="  Make stdout line buffered. Useful if you want to see the data while capturing it."/>
		<option name="-L" description="  List the known data link types for the interface, in the specified mode, and exit. The list of known data link types may be dependent on the specified mode; for example, on some platforms, a Wi-Fi interface might support one set of data link types when not in monitor mode (for example, it might support only fake Ethernet headers, or might support 802.11 headers but not support 802.11 headers with radio information) and another set of data link types when in monitor mode (for example, it might support 802.11 headers, or 802.11 headers with radio information, only in monitor mode)."/>
		<option name="-m" description="  Load SMI MIB module definitions from file module. This option can be used several times to load several MIB modules into tcpdump."/>
		<option name="-M" description="  Use secret as a shared secret for validating the digests found in TCP segments with the TCP-MD5 option (RFC 2385), if present."/>
		<option name="-n" description="  Dont convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names."/>
		<option name="-N" description="  Dont print domain name qualification of host names. E.g., if you give this flag then tcpdump will print ``nic instead of ``nic.ddn.mil."/>
		<option name="-O" description="  Do not run the packet-matching code optimizer. This is useful only if you suspect a bug in the optimizer."/>
		<option name="-p" description="  Dont put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note that the interface might be in promiscuous mode for some other reason; hence, `-p cannot be used as an abbreviation for `ether host {local-hw-addr} or ether broadcast."/>
		<option name="-q" description="  Quick (quiet?) output. Print less protocol information so output lines are shorter."/>
		<option name="-R" description="  Assume ESP/AH packets to be based on old specification (RFC1825 to RFC1829). If specified, tcpdump will not print replay prevention field. Since there is no protocol version field in ESP/AH specification, tcpdump cannot deduce the version of ESP/AH protocol."/>
		<option name="-r" description="  Read packets from file (which was created with the -w option). Standard input is used if file is ``-."/>
		<option name="-S" description="  Print absolute, rather than relative, TCP sequence numbers."/>
		<option name="-s" description="  Snarf snaplen bytes of data from each packet rather than the default of 65535 bytes. Packets truncated because of a limited snapshot are indicated in the output with ``[|proto], where proto is the name of the protocol level at which the truncation has occurred. Note that taking larger snapshots both increases the amount of time it takes to process packets and, effectively, decreases the amount of packet buffering. This may cause packets to be lost. You should limit snaplen to the smallest number that will capture the protocol information youre interested in. Setting snaplen to 0 sets it to the default of 65535, for backwards compatibility with recent older versions of tcpdump."/>
		<option name="-T" description="  Force packets selected by expression to be interpreted the specified type. Currently known types are aodv (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector protocol), cnfp (Cisco NetFlow protocol), rpc (Remote Procedure Call), rtp (Real-Time Applications protocol), rtcp (Real-Time Applications control protocol), snmp (Simple Network Management Protocol), tftp (Trivial File Transfer Protocol), vat (Visual Audio Tool), and wb (distributed White Board)."/>
		<option name="-t" description="  Dont print a timestamp on each dump line."/>
		<option name="-tt" description="  Print an unformatted timestamp on each dump line."/>
		<option name="-ttt" description="  Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and previous line on each dump line."/>
		<option name="-tttt" description="  Print a timestamp in default format proceeded by date on each dump line."/>
		<option name="-ttttt" description="  Print a delta (micro-second resolution) between current and first line on each dump line."/>
		<option name="-u" description="  Print undecoded NFS handles."/>
		<option name="-U" description="  Make output saved via the -w option ``packet-buffered; i.e., as each packet is saved, it will be written to the output file, rather than being written only when the output buffer fills.  The -U flag will not be supported if tcpdump was built with an older version of libpcap that lacks the pcap_dump_flush() function."/>
		<option name="-v" description="  When parsing and printing, produce (slightly more) verbose output. For example, the time to live, identification, total length and options in an IP packet are printed. Also enables additional packet integrity checks such as verifying the IP and ICMP header checksum.  When writing to a file with the -w option, report, every 10 seconds, the number of packets captured."/>
		<option name="-vv" description="  Even more verbose output. For example, additional fields are printed from NFS reply packets, and SMB packets are fully decoded."/>
		<option name="-vvv" description="  Even more verbose output. For example, telnet SB ... SE options are printed in full. With -X Telnet options are printed in hex as well."/>
		<option name="-w" description="  Write the raw packets to file rather than parsing and printing them out. They can later be printed with the -r option. Standard output is used if file is ``-. See pcap-savefile(5) for a description of the file format."/>
		<option name="-W" description="  Used in conjunction with the -C option, this will limit the number of files created to the specified number, and begin overwriting files from the beginning, thus creating a rotating buffer. In addition, it will name the files with enough leading 0s to support the maximum number of files, allowing them to sort correctly.  Used in conjunction with the -G option, this will limit the number of rotated dump files that get created, exiting with status 0 when reaching the limit. If used with -C as well, the behavior will result in cyclical files per timeslice."/>
		<option name="-x" description="  When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet (minus its link level header) in hex. The smaller of the entire packet or snaplen bytes will be printed. Note that this is the entire link-layer packet, so for link layers that pad (e.g. Ethernet), the padding bytes will also be printed when the higher layer packet is shorter than the required padding."/>
		<option name="-xx" description="  When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet, including its link level header, in hex."/>
		<option name="-X" description="  When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet (minus its link level header) in hex and ASCII. This is very handy for analysing new protocols."/>
		<option name="-XX" description="  When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet, including its link level header, in hex and ASCII."/>
		<option name="-y" description="  Set the data link type to use while capturing packets to datalinktype."/>
		<option name="-z" description="  Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make tcpdump run  command file where file is the savefile being closed after each rotation. For example, specifying -z gzip or -z bzip2 will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.  Note that tcpdump will run the command in parallel to the capture, using the lowest priority so that this doesnt disturb the capture process.  And in case you would like to use a command that itself takes flags or different arguments, you can always write a shell script that will take the savefile name as the only argument, make the flags  arguments arrangements and execute the command that you want."/>
		<option name="-Z" description="  Drops privileges (if root) and changes user ID to user and the group ID to the primary group of user.  This behavior can also be enabled by default at compile time. "/>
